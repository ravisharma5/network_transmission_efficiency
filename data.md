Channel Gain vs. Transmit Power
Overview

In wireless communication, the channel gain refers to the signal attenuation between the transmitter and receiver. Transmit power is the amount of power used by a transmitter to send signals over a wireless channel. The goal is to adjust transmit power based on channel gain to maintain signal quality while conserving power and minimizing interference.

This dataset provides sample input values of channel gain and their corresponding transmit power. The data can be used to model how transmit power is influenced by channel conditions, enabling the prediction and optimization of power allocation in real-time wireless systems.
Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following variables:

    Channel Gain (A): Represented as a 4-dimensional vector. These values describe the signal attenuation across different channels.
    Transmit Power (B): A 2-dimensional vector representing the power levels that the transmitter should allocate across two transmission paths based on channel gain.

Sample Data:

    If channel gain is [59.6, 73.2, 59.8, 63.6], then transmit power is [100, 100].
    If channel gain is [71.0, 59.8, 61.9, 73.7], then transmit power is [0, 100].
    If channel gain is [61.4, 65.8, 66.0, 66.9], then transmit power is [100, 0].
    If channel gain is [62.3, 58.9, 72.8, 54.0], then transmit power is [100, 100].

Additional rows in the dataset follow a similar structure.
Key Factors Influencing Transmit Power

    Channel Gain: The larger the channel gain, the lower the transmit power needed to maintain signal quality, and vice versa.
    Interference: Higher levels of interference may require increased transmit power to overcome signal degradation.
    Noise: Ambient noise in the environment can also affect the required transmit power levels.
    Optimization: Transmit power must be optimized to balance signal quality, energy consumption, and interference reduction.

Conclusions

This dataset can be used to train models that predict the appropriate transmit power based on the given channel gain. By learning from these examples, the model can optimize power allocation for real-time communication systems, ensuring efficiency and reliability.
