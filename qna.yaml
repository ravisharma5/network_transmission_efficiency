      - question: |
          What is channel gain in wireless communication?
        answer: |
          Channel gain refers to the signal attenuation between the transmitter
          and receiver.
      - question: |
          What is transmit power in wireless communication?
        answer: |
          Transmit power is the amount of power used by a transmitter to send
          signals over a wireless channel.
      - question: |
          How does channel gain affect transmit power?
        answer: |
          When the channel gain is high, less transmit power is required to
          maintain signal quality. Conversely, when the channel gain is low,
          more transmit power is needed to overcome the signal loss.
      - question: |
          What is the transmit power for channel gain values [59.6, 73.2, 59.8,
          63.6]?
        answer: |
          The transmit power is [100, 100].
      - question: |
          What is the transmit power for channel gain values [71.0, 59.8, 61.9,
          73.7]?
        answer: |
          The transmit power is [0, 100].
      - question: |
          What is the transmit power for channel gain values [61.4, 65.8, 66.0,
          66.9]?
        answer: |
          The transmit power is [100, 0].
      - question: |
          What is the transmit power for channel gain values [53.4, 51.3, 61.1,
          68.9]?
        answer: |
          The transmit power is [100, 0].
      - question: |
          What is the transmit power for channel gain values [62.3, 58.9, 72.8,
          54.0]?
        answer: |
          The transmit power is [100, 100].
      - question: |
          What is the transmit power for channel gain values [74.1, 62.3, 64.0,
          68.9]?
        answer: |
          The transmit power is [0, 100].
