# network_transmission_efficiency
This repo has notebook code to demonstrate how we can use GenAI for maximize either Spectral Efficiency (SE) or Energy Efficiency (EE), while considering interference management and quality-of-service constraints for both the cellular users (CUEs) and the D2D users (DUEs).
