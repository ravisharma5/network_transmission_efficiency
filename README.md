This notebook is performing optimization of power allocation for a D2D (Device-to-Device) communication system underlaying a cellular network. The overall goal is to maximize either Spectral Efficiency (SE) or Energy Efficiency (EE), while considering interference management and quality-of-service constraints for both the cellular users (CUEs) and the D2D users (DUEs).

Here's a breakdown of the major components:
1. Channel Modeling

    The system considers multiple channels (frequency bands) shared between CUEs and DUEs.
    Each user is assigned a set of channels, and the channel matrices define the link quality between CUEs, DUEs, and the base station.

2. Transmit Power Allocation

    The core task is to allocate transmit power levels to DUEs on each channel.
    The notebook generates all possible combinations of power allocations for a given number of channels, users, and power level granularity.

Function:

    all_possible_tx_power: Generates all possible power level combinations for users across multiple channels.

3. Performance Metrics

    Two key metrics are calculated based on the transmit power allocation:
        Spectral Efficiency (SE): The rate of data transmission per unit bandwidth.
        Energy Efficiency (EE): The amount of data transmitted per unit of energy consumed.
    Additional constraints such as interference thresholds (CUE interference) and DUE rate thresholds are enforced.

Functions:

    cal_RATE_one_sample_one_channel: Calculates the rate for each D2D link on a single channel.
    cal_CUE_INTER_one_sample_one_channel: Calculates interference caused to the CUEs.

4. Optimization (Power Control)

    The notebook explores different transmit power levels for each DUE to optimize either SE or EE, subject to constraints.
    The optimization ensures that the selected power allocation satisfies both DUE and CUE constraints.

Functions:

    optimal_power: Implements the optimization to find the best transmit power configuration to maximize SE or EE.
    cal_rate_NP: Calculates SE and EE for a given power configuration across all users and channels.

5. Infeasibility Handling

    During the optimization process, some channel conditions might lead to infeasibility (e.g., where no power allocation can meet the constraints). These scenarios are tracked and stored for analysis.

Function:

    The chan_infea_mat array stores channels for which no feasible power allocation is found.

6. Usage of Parameters

    Key inputs to the optimization include:
        Maximum Transmit Power (tx_max): The upper limit on the power that DUEs can transmit.
        Noise Power (noise): The noise level in the system.
        DUE Threshold (DUE_thr): The minimum rate that DUEs must achieve.
        Interference Threshold (I_thr): The maximum interference that can be tolerated by CUEs.
        Power Consumption (P_c): Constant power consumption overhead.

7. Batch Processing

    The notebook processes multiple channel realizations in batches to find the optimal power allocations for each realization.

Overall Workflow:

    Power Generation: Generate possible power allocations for each user and channel combination.
    Optimization: For each channel realization, evaluate SE/EE for all power allocations, enforce the constraints, and choose the best allocation.
    Constraint Checking: Ensure that both CUE and DUE thresholds are satisfied, and handle cases where they aren't.
    Performance Evaluation: Return optimized values for SE and EE and track any infeasible channels.

Objective:

The notebook aims to find the optimal power allocation strategy that either maximizes spectral or energy efficiency while meeting interference and quality-of-service constraints in a D2D communication system.
